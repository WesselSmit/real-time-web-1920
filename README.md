# Concept

This app allows people to troubleshoot your code, through: pull requests, syntax highlighting & chat help.

The app has  sections:
* [left] The host (and only the host) can type their code (source code)
* [middle] Pull requests & Code suggestions; users can suggest improvements through pull requests
     * [pull request] Users can reference source code line(s) and make suggestions (host can either accept or decline these, accepting overwrites referenced source code lines with pulled reuest)
* [right] Navigation & info
     * [rooms] List of available rooms (available coding/programming languages)
     * [users] List of users in current room

 
### API

The idea is to use an API to show daily coding related questions, I'm not quite sure which API or idea to go with:
* show daily coding challenges **[can't find an API for this!]**
* show daily coding tips **[can't find an API for this!]**
* show daily tweets relating to JS (or even coding/programming in general)
